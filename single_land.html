    1. Games are games designed for only one player or games played in the single-player mode. While this means the game would only have one explicit player, the space of play may include multiple players. For instance, a game like Oregon Trail may have only one player handling the controls, but multiple players could be collaboratively discussing and deciding what to do next and those multiple players may switch places to allow each a “turn” at handling the game controls.

    2. A game that can be played on a single device, be it a powerful desktop computer system or a small resource-limited handheld device. Such games typically involve the user playing against the computer, which would usually have some AI elements. Learn more in: From Single to Multiplayer Mobile Bluetooth Gaming
